sosg is  a simple viewer for NOAA Science on a Sphere datasets
on Snow Globe, a low cost, open source, DIY spherical display.
SOS Datasets available at: http://sos.noaa.gov
Snow Globe information at: http://eclecti.cc

USAGE
==============================================================================

sosg [OPTION] [FILES]

    Input Data
        -i     Display an image or slideshow (Default)
        -v     Display a video or videos
        -p     Satellite tracking as a PREDICT client
        -s     Optional string to overlay

    Snow Globe Configuration
        -f     Fullscreen
        -w     Display width in pixels (848)
        -h     Display height in pixels (480)
        -r     Radius in pixels (378.0)
        -x     X offset in pixels (431.0)
        -y     Y offset in pixels (210.0)
        -o     Lens offset in pixels (370.0)

    Adjacent Reality Tracker (optional)
        -t     Path to the Tracker device

The left and right arrow keys can be used to rotate the sphere.
Holding shift while using the arrows changes rotation speed.
p will stop the rotation and r resets the angle.
The up and down arrow keys go to the previous or next image in image mode.

DEPENDENCIES
==============================================================================

I've tried to use cross platform libraries as much as possible, but I don't
have anything but Linux to test it on.  It may just work elsewhere, but
it probably requires some minor changes.

SDL 1.2
SDL image 1.2
SDL net 1.2
SDL gfx 2.0.22
SDL ttf 2.0
OpenGL 2.1
libvlc 1.1.1

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
